jDBase - A future concept and research project to enhance localStorage client side data preservation to the next step

==========================================================================

The motive and end goal for jDBase was to make localStorage have a more user friendly way of communicating with 

it, when it is being implemented on a bigger scale. If you are using it to store one or two custom attributes, then this would

not be very probable for you to use. It is when you have a lot more data, and complexity needed with it,

that the library brings fourth it's power and use.  When cookies were the main factor of client side storage preservation,

we longed for something better. Something that offered more capabilities. Local storage did just that. Though, after extensively using

it, I started getting annoyed with the very clunky feel to it, and how much you had to do, for simple situations. This, I hope

, will bring a different look upon localStorage, and what can be done with it. 


I will eventually have documentation out there, to show some key examples of usage for it. Until then, it is primarily

in the development process, and in turn, would not be reasonable to have documentation for it. Please follow this 

project, and put fourth any key ideas, modifications, and needs/applicable want you see from it in the future.


I know there is something more to client side storage, and am hoping this is the path to take. The real proof though, will

be how the development community sees it, and if they see it in the same light I do, with the same dream that drives me.

A data base feel, a data base implementation, and a familiar but new dynamic to client side data preservation.



Thanks for any support, and will hope to hear some insights on this project as it progresses.

I can be contacted at caseypharr@outlook.com for any conversations regarding this project.


====================================================================
-Current Status-

jDBase is currently in the very early stages of development, and will be morphing a lot in the near future. I am, at the

moment, working out different philosophies and ideas that are stemming from its progression. The dynamic, I assume,

will dramatically change before any beta releases are ready. At the momentum this is purely research and theoretical.
