When cookies were the only way to store information on the client side, we longed for another method. Somthing that was 
more pratical, secure, and allowed more storage space. The, in the HTML5 overhaul, came along localStorage. This
opned new doors, and allowed somthing more practical. Among all of these great steps in client side storage, I felt it was 
still lacking somthing truly capable of doing the job, and doing it effeciently. I hated the idea, of making multiple calls,
to the localStorage functionality, and being able to do single data storage. So, this library was created. The concept and idea
I am driving towards, is a way to be able to store more data, on the client side, in a practical way. This library uses the concept of
data bases, tables, and query language to store client side data. It runs soley on javascript, and uses the current localStorage API.

I will continue to update the process, as I move along. PLease feel free to partici[ate in this process, so I cam make this happend
, more for research reasons than anything else, and make it usable. Thanks, and have fun!
